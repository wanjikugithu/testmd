    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        The rapidly increasing ability to measure or index farmer losses at low cost opens the door not only to insurance as a stand-alone product, 
        but also to exploiting the natural synergies between agricultural insurance and credit.  Bundling credit and insurance can reduce farmer’s reluctance 
        to borrow for fear of the consequences of loan default.  Bundling can also reduce lenders’ reluctance to offer agricultural credit, especially to seemingly 
        risky small holder farmers.  Experience shows that such bundling can work (especially for women farmers, but that it is also tricky to implement and founders 
        when farmers, rightly or wrongly, do not trust the underlying loss index). 

 
    </p>
    <p>
       Insurance and credit can also be blended together in the sense that some risk is covered by insurance while some by pre-approved contingent loans that 
       become available only after the loss index signals that farmers need help.  Experience shows that such indexed credit lines can provide many of the same 
       benefits as index insurance, and make it easier for farmers to learn about and trust financial products. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In response to the renewed interest in credit and insurance in East and Southern Africa, we propose a 3-day workshop to bring together various stakeholders 
        along the supply chain. The workshop will combine lessons learned by researchers and practitioners on blending and bundling insurance and credit.  It will also 
        cover the rapidly advancing science and practice of farmer loss estimation so that reliable indexes—the heart of all of these financial products—can be 
        identified and constructed.  As a final outcome, we hope that workshop participants can forge new partnerships that can refine and scale-up risk management 
        products that can lay the ground work for an inclusive agricultural transformation in the region.
